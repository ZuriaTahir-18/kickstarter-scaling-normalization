# Kickstarter Scaling and Normalization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for practicing data preprocessing techniques—specifically scaling and normalization—on Kickstarter campaign data.

## Objective
- Apply **min-max scaling** to campaign goal values.
- Apply **normalization** (e.g., Box-Cox or similar) to pledged amounts to stabilize variance and approach a normal distribution.
- Visualize the effect of these transformations.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- mlxtend (installed in the notebook)

## Files
- `kickstarter_scaling_normalization.ipynb`: Main assignment notebook performing scaling and normalization.## Dataset Source

Kickstarter Projects dataset sourced from Kaggle:

## Dataset
- `kickstarters_2017.csv`: Kickstarter campaign data including fields like goal, pledged amount, etc.
  

## Key Concepts Practiced
- Min-Max Scaling
- Data Normalization (e.g., Box-Cox transform)
- Distribution visualization before and after transformation
